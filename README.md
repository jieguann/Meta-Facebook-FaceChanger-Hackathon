# AR Bian Lian (Face Changing) 

A facial-mask changing AR experience inspired by an ancient Chinese dramatic art, the magic of Bian Lian (Face Changing), amplifies the affluence and buoyancy of complicated human emotions. 
There always seems to be a strong intertwined force pulling history to the present and the present to history. The modern hieroglyphical language of emojis, the trend to express in motion through dance, and interactions with bodily movements. Virtual avatars and AR filters of self-presentations, resembling the ancient custom to mask and disguise for survival, and ritualistic presentation to the ethereal. It seems there is always something naturally innate hidden beneath all complexities of a human, rooting from the past to the future, as we discover and rediscover it in time.
