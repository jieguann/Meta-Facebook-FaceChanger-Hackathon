# AR Bian Lian (Face Changing) 

A facial-mask changing AR experience inspired by an ancient Chinese dramatic art, the magic of Bian Lian (Face Changing), amplifies the affluence and buoyancy of complicated human emotions. 
There always seems to be a strong intertwined force pulling history to the present and the present to history. The modern hieroglyphical language of emojis, the trend to express in motion through dance, and interactions with bodily movements. Virtual avatars and AR filters of self-presentations, resembling the ancient custom to mask and disguise for survival, and ritualistic presentation to the ethereal. It seems there is always something naturally innate hidden beneath all complexities of a human, rooting from the past to the future, as we discover and rediscover it in time.

### The Issue
Everyone is unique, how can we extend and manifest this uniqueness in the metaverse? We seek for more dynamic potentials in virtual representations, avatars and facial expressions, which are currently generalized and limited. Avatars is a channel of communication, more significant than ever in the metaverse, we should imagine new dynamics to give user full freedom for this visual language.

### Our Magic Solution
Through the magic of Bian Lian, an ancient Chinese dramatic art, which amplifies on affluence and buoyancy of human emotions, combined with the modern hieroglyphical language of emojis. Users can interact and reflect, on the complicated mixture of human emotions so often generalized, that is now dramatically augmented through a dynamic mix of traditional and modern elements of facial expressions.
